The code in this modules used to communicate with the streetlights API was adapted from the JS code in the [CityIQ-Starter-Code repo](https://github.com/CityIQ/CityIQ-Starter-Code).

Methods are available to:
- get a token
- get assets by a bounding box
- get events for an asset
- get locations for a bounding box
- get asset information by asset ID

TODO:
- get events by bounding box
- ...wrap other capabilities of the API?
